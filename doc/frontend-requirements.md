# Frontend Requirements

This document outlines the requirements and decisions for the frontend of the game project, based on our research and discussion in previous tasks.

## 1. Framework and Tooling

- **Framework:**
  - We have chosen **Vue** as the core framework for the web application.
  - The project will use TypeScript for enhanced type safety and maintainability.

- **Build Tool:**
  - The latest version of **Vite** will be used to provide a fast and modern build process.

- **Styling:**
  - **Tailwind CSS 4.x** will be employed to ensure a responsive and customizable design system.

## 2. 3D Integration

- **Rendering Library:**
  - **Three.js** is the chosen 3D rendering library due to its maturity, flexibility, and strong community support.
  - Integration with Vue is facilitated by community resources and established patterns.

## 3. Project Structure for Frontend

- The frontend code will reside in the `/src/ui` directory.
- It will contain the main Vue components, configuration files (e.g., `vite.config.ts`), and entry points for the application.

## 4. Development and Best Practices

- Use modular component design to promote reusability and maintainability.
- Follow modern web development practices to ensure compatibility across current browsers.
- Optimize performance for dynamic interaction and real-time updates within the game.

## 5. Future Enhancements

- Explore additional integrations or libraries as needed based on evolving project requirements.
- Continuously assess UI/UX improvements as the application evolves.
