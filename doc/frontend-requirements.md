# Frontend Requirements

This document outlines the requirements and decisions for the frontend of the game project, based on our research and discussion in previous tasks.

## 1. Framework and Tooling

- **Core Framework:**
  - **Vue 3** as the primary framework, utilizing the Composition API for better code organization, reusability, and TypeScript integration.
  - **TypeScript 5** for enhanced type safety, developer experience, and maintainability.

- **Build Tools:**
  - **Vite 6** for fast development and optimized production builds.
  - **ESLint** and **Prettier** for code quality and consistent formatting.
  - **Vitest** for unit testing Vue components and utilities.

- **Styling:**
  - **Tailwind CSS 4.x** for utility-first styling with component extraction.
  - **PostCSS** plugins for additional styling capabilities.

- **State Management:**
  - **Pinia** as the recommended state management solution for Vue 3.
  - Feature-based store organization for better scalability.

- **Routing:**
  - **Vue Router 4.x** for page routing with code-splitting capabilities.
  - Route guard integration for authentication and authorization.

## 2. 3D Integration

- **Rendering Library:**
  - **Three.js** for 3D rendering, selected for its maturity, flexibility, and strong community support.
  - Custom composables for Three.js integration with Vue 3's reactivity system.
  - Performance optimization through WebGL best practices.

## 3. Project Structure for Frontend

### Feature-Based Architecture
The frontend code will follow a feature-based architecture that groups related components, composables, and stores by domain rather than by type:

- **/src/ui**: Base directory for the Vue application
  - **/assets**: Static assets (images, fonts, global styles)
  - **/components**: Reusable UI components
    - **/common**: Shared UI components (buttons, inputs, etc.)
    - **/layout**: Layout components (headers, footers, etc.)
    - **/game**: Game-specific UI components
  - **/composables**: Vue 3 composition API functions
  - **/features**: Feature-based modules
    - **/auth**: Authentication related components and logic
    - **/city**: City management features
    - **/player**: Player-related features
    - **/social**: Social interaction features
  - **/pages**: Top-level page components
  - **/router**: Vue Router configuration
  - **/stores**: Pinia stores for state management
  - **/services**: API services and external integrations
  - **/styles**: Tailwind configuration and global styles
  - **/types**: TypeScript type definitions
  - **/utils**: Utility functions

### Component Organization
Components will follow a hierarchy inspired by atomic design principles:
- **Common components**: Small, reusable UI elements
- **Feature components**: Domain-specific components
- **Layout components**: Structure and page layout
- **Page components**: Top-level route components

## 4. Development and Best Practices

- **Composition API**: Use composition functions (composables) to share logic between components.
- **Type Safety**: Utilize TypeScript for all components, stores, and utilities.
- **Responsive Design**: Implement mobile-first responsive design using Tailwind breakpoints.
- **Performance Optimization**:
  - Implement code-splitting for routes and large components
  - Use lightweight rendering techniques for game UI
  - Optimize asset loading and caching
- **Testing**:
  - Unit test components and composables with Vitest
  - Implement component documentation with Storybook or similar tool

## 5. Frontend-Backend Integration

- Create type-safe API services using TypeScript interfaces shared with the backend
- Implement WebSocket client with automatic reconnection and message queueing
- Use Pinia stores to manage server state and synchronization

## 6. Future Enhancements

- Explore additional optimizations for 3D rendering performance
- Consider implementing WebGL shaders for custom visual effects
- Evaluate WebAssembly for performance-critical computations
- Continuously assess UI/UX improvements as the application evolves
