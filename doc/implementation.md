# Implementation Task Plan

This document outlines a detailed task plan to build the game described in [project.md]. It includes a breakdown of the phases, steps, required tools, and milestones required to bring the game from concept to a complete, functioning product.

## Overview

The game is an ambitious project focusing on complex simulations, dynamic city environments, and AI-driven interactions. It requires a well-thought-out architecture, a robust game engine, and a comprehensive development strategy.

## Task Breakdown

1. **Design Phase**
   - Analyze requirements from [project.md].
   - Identify core game modules such as the game engine, AI components, graphics engine, and physics simulation.
   - Establish design patterns and system architecture that will support modular development and scalability.

2. **Architecture & Planning**
   - Draft system architecture diagrams outlining the key components and their interactions.
   - Define interfaces and communication protocols among game modules.
   - Research and select the tools, libraries, and game engines (custom engine vs. integration with existing ones like Unity or Unreal) best suited for the project.

3. **Prototyping**
   - Develop a prototype focusing on the key aspects of the game:
     - Core game loop and rendering mechanics.
     - Basic AI behaviors and interactions.
     - Initial user interface prototypes.
   - Iterate on the prototype based on testing and feedback.

4. **Development**
   - **Game Engine Development:** Implement the chosen engine or customize an existing one.
   - **Module Implementation:** Develop the individual modules including graphics, physics, AI, and networking if multiplayer is planned.
   - **Integration:** Ensure seamless interaction between various components and modules.
   - **User Interface:** Build an immersive and user-friendly front-end. The UI will be implemented as a modern web application designed to run in current browsers, leveraging HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (or modern frameworks such as React or Vue) for responsive design and dynamic interactions.
   - **Quality Assurance:** Integrate unit tests and continuous integration to maintain code quality throughout the development process.

5. **Testing and Optimization**
   - Implement thorough testing procedures (unit tests, integration tests, performance tests).
   - Optimize game performance, fix bugs, and refine AI interactions and graphics rendering.
   - Gather user feedback and iterate on improvements.

6. **Deployment and Maintenance**
   - Plan for deployment, including setting up a build pipeline and release management.
   - Establish a maintenance schedule for updates, bug fixes, and performance enhancements.
   - Create documentation and support materials for users and developers.

## Required Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Languages:** Likely C++, C#, or a language that best fits the chosen game engine and platform requirements.
- **Game Engine:** Evaluation of custom game engine development versus using engines like Unity or Unreal.
- **Graphics Libraries:** OpenGL, DirectX, or Vulkan for rendering.
- **Physics Engine:** Integration with Bullet or a similar physics engine.
- **AI Libraries:** Tools and libraries supporting AI-driven behavior and dynamic interactions.
- **Development Tools:** Version control (e.g., Git), project management software, continuous integration tools.

## Milestones

- Completion of requirements analysis and design documentation.
- Initial prototype development and feedback iteration.
- Alpha release showcasing core functionalities.
- Beta release with expanded features for user testing.
- Full release with comprehensive game features.
- Ongoing updates and maintenance post-release.

## Summary

This task plan serves as a roadmap for the game development process, ensuring that each phase—from initial design to final deployment—is executed systematically and efficiently. The plan is based on the vision outlined in [project.md] and will guide the development team through careful planning, prototyping, development, and post-launch maintenance.
