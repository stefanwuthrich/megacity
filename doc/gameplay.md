# Gameplay Overview

This document outlines how the game works and details the features that will be implemented to create a dynamic, interactive, and massively multiplayer online city simulation experience.

## 1. Game Concept

The game is a dynamic city simulation that brings a modern urban environment to life through advanced AI, realistic physics, and immersive 3D visuals. It is designed as a massive multiplayer online (MMO) game where players interact within a living city, making strategic decisions and shaping the urban landscape.

## 2. Key Features

- **Dynamic City Simulation:** An evolving urban landscape featuring realistic buildings, traffic systems, and environmental elements that change with day/night cycles, weather, and seasons.
- **Advanced AI-Driven NPC Behavior:** Intelligent NPCs that simulate daily routines, react to events, and interact with each other, adding realism to the city.
- **Real-Time Physics and 3D Rendering:** High-quality 3D rendering using Three.js coupled with realistic physics simulation via Cannon.js for interactive and engaging visuals.
- **Interactive User Experience:** A modern, responsive web interface built with Vue, Vite, and TypeScript, enabling players to control and interact with the city.
- **Real-Time Communication:** Low-latency, real-time data exchange between the backend and frontend using WebSockets.
- **Robust Backend Integration:** A backend system built in Go using net/http, incorporating Couchbase, Redis, and Zitadel for user management and secure authentication.

## 3. Gameplay Mechanics

- **City Simulation & Management:**
  - Players experience a living city where urban components such as traffic, public services, and environmental elements work autonomously and interact dynamically.
  - Strategic decisions influence city operations, affecting everything from traffic management to resource allocation.

- **Event-Driven Interactions:**
  - Both random and scripted events (e.g., accidents, emergencies, public rallies) trigger dynamic responses from AI-controlled citizens and city systems.
  - Timely player interventions can mitigate adverse effects or capitalize on emergent opportunities.

- **Progression and Role Evolution:**
  - Players start as individuals, progressing by creating a family, renting housing, and eventually constructing their own homes.
  - As players earn points and level up, they gain eligibility for leadership roles within the city.

## 4. User Interaction and Control

- **Intuitive Interface:**
  - The frontend provides clear dashboards for monitoring city metrics, control panels for decision-making, and interactive maps for exploration.

- **Customization and Upgrades:**
  - Players can customize elements of the city, upgrade infrastructure, and unlock new features as they progress.

## 5. Future Enhancements

Future updates may expand gameplay with additional simulation layers such as economic systems, environmental sustainability, and complex social dynamics. Enhanced multiplayer features and advanced AI techniques will also be considered as the project evolves.

## 6. Multiplayer & Social Dynamics

**MMO:** The game is massively multiplayer online. Players begin as individuals and progress through various stages: creating a family, renting a house, and constructing their own residence. As players earn points and level up, they become eligible to be elected as a city mayor by their peers.

- **City Leadership and Governance:** City mayors have the authority to construct essential public infrastructure, such as schools, hospitals, and cultural centers.
- **Inter-City Interaction:** Multiple cities exist within the game world; these cities can interact through business, trade, and cooperative events.
- **Democratic Processes:** The system is designed to operate democratically. City budgets and major projects require approval from residents, with proposals put forward by the mayor and voted on by the community.
