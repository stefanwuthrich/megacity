# Backend Requirements and Design

This document outlines the backend requirements and architectural decisions for the game project. The backend is responsible for handling server-side logic, real-time communication, data persistence, and integration with the AI module.

## 1. Technology Stack

- **Language:** Go
- **Framework:** Use the standard net/http package from Go 1.24 for API development. Optional libraries such as chi can be integrated as needed.
- **Real-time Communication:** Use WebSockets for real-time communication between the backend and frontend.
- **Database:** Use Couchbase for document-oriented data storage and flexible queries, along with Redis for caching and in-memory operations to provide low latency and scalability.
- **Authentication:** Use ZItadel Cloud for user management, login, and integrate with Zitadel for RESTful APIs where needed.

## 2. Key Responsibilities

- **Game State Management:** Maintain the simulation state, manage game sessions, and ensure real-time data updates.
- **Real-Time Communication:** Facilitate real-time interactions between the backend and the frontend (e.g., using WebSockets).
- **Data Persistence:** Store persistent data such as player profiles, game state, logs, etc.
- **AI Integration:** Coordinate with AI modules, offloading simulation tasks as needed.

## 3. Scalability and Performance

- Design the backend to handle high concurrency and real-time updates.
- Consider strategies for load balancing, caching (e.g., Redis), and horizontal scaling.

## 4. Security and Data Integrity

- Define methods for secure data transmission and storage.
- Implement robust error handling and data validation routines.

## 5. Future Considerations

- **Framework Choice:** Finalize the selection of a Go web framework.
- **Real-Time Protocol:** Decide on the protocol (WebSockets vs. gRPC) based on performance and ease of integration considerations.
- **Service Architecture:** Explore microservices or a monolithic approach based on project scale.

## Next Steps

1. Select a Go web framework (e.g., Gin, Echo, Fiber).
2. Decide on the real-time communication mechanism (e.g., WebSockets, gRPC).
3. Determine the database solution and authentication approach.
