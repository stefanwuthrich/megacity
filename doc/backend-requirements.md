# Backend Requirements and Design

This document outlines the backend requirements and architectural decisions for the game project. The backend is responsible for handling server-side logic, real-time communication, data persistence, and integration with the AI module.

## 1. Technology Stack

- **Language:** Go
- **Framework:** Use the standard net/http package from Go 1.24 for API development. Optional libraries such as chi can be integrated as needed.
- **Real-time Communication:** Use WebSockets for real-time communication between the backend and frontend.
- **Database:** 
  - PostgreSQL for structured data requiring strong consistency (users, authentication, governance)
  - MongoDB for flexible document storage (game state, content, AI data)
  - Redis for caching and real-time operations
- **Authentication:** Use ZItadel Cloud for user management, login, and integrate with Zitadel for RESTful APIs where needed.

## 2. Key Responsibilities

- **Game State Management:**
  - Maintain the overall simulation state of the game.
  - Manage game sessions and synchronize state updates in real time.

- **Real-Time Communication:**
  - Utilize WebSockets to enable low-latency, real-time data exchange between the backend and the Vue-based frontend.

- **Data Persistence:**
  - Use PostgreSQL for user data, authentication, governance, and transactions requiring ACID compliance
  - Employ MongoDB for complex game state, content management, and AI-related data
  - Leverage Redis for caching, session management, and real-time data requiring low latency
  - Implement a unified data access layer to abstract database technologies from business logic

- **AI Integration:**
  - Interface with the AI modules to support offloading of computational tasks, ensuring effective real-time decision making.

- **Scalability and Performance:**
  - Implement monitoring and logging to continuously assess backend performance.
  - Design for horizontal scaling, load balancing, and efficient resource utilization.

## 3. Scalability and Performance

- **Load Balancing:** Utilize a reverse proxy to distribute incoming requests and manage load balancing.

- **Horizontal Scaling:** Scale the backend horizontally using Docker containers. Kubernetes will not be used at this stage.

- **Database Scaling:** 
  - Implement connection pooling for all database connections
  - Utilize read replicas where appropriate for PostgreSQL
  - Consider sharding strategies for MongoDB as data volume grows
  - Implement comprehensive Redis caching to reduce load on primary databases

- **Monitoring and Logging:** Implement continuous monitoring and logging to assess performance and identify bottlenecks.

## 4. Security and Data Integrity

- **Transport Encryption:** Ensure that all communications between the client and server are encrypted using TLS.

- **Data Encryption at Rest:** Encrypt sensitive data stored in PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and any other persistent storage where applicable.

- **Input Sanitization and Validation:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization to protect against injection attacks and other vulnerabilities.

- **Access Control and Role-Based Permissions:** Define and enforce access controls and role-based permissions to restrict unauthorized access to sensitive data and endpoints.

- **Audit Logging and Monitoring:** Log security-related events and continuously monitor the system to detect and respond to suspicious activities.

- **Error Handling:** Implement robust, secure error handling practices to avoid leaking sensitive information.

## 5. Database Management

- **Data Migration:** Implement a comprehensive migration strategy with tools like Flyway (PostgreSQL) and MongoDB Compass.

- **Schema Evolution:** Use versioned migration scripts to manage schema changes, supporting both forward and rollback migrations.

- **Data Access Patterns:** Implement the repository pattern with clear interfaces to abstract database implementation details from business logic.

- **Query Optimization:** Regularly analyze and optimize database queries, ensuring appropriate indexes are in place.

- **Backup and Recovery:** Establish robust backup procedures for all databases with regular testing of recovery processes.

## 6. Future Considerations

- **Framework and Middleware:** Evaluate additional Go libraries or middleware if specific performance or integration requirements evolve.
- **Real-Time Communication Alternatives:** Explore advanced protocols (e.g., gRPC) as a potential alternative to WebSockets if needed in the future.
- **Security Updates:** Periodically review and update the security framework to adopt new best practices and mitigate emerging threats.
- **Scaling Strategies:** Consider more advanced container orchestration or scaling strategies beyond Docker if required.
- **Performance Testing:** Implement robust performance benchmarks and stress tests within the CI/CD pipeline to validate scaling efficiency and load balancing.
- **Analytics Database:** Consider implementing ClickHouse for advanced analytics needs as the project matures.

## Next Steps

- **Design Finalization:** Complete the detailed design and implementation plan for the backend, integrating Go's net/http, WebSockets (using Gorilla or another package), PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, and Zitadel Cloud.

- **Prototyping:** Develop proof-of-concept prototypes for core components such as API endpoints, real-time communication, and database interactions.

- **Database Schema Design:** Create initial schemas for PostgreSQL and document structures for MongoDB, with clear data access patterns.

- **CI/CD Integration:** Integrate the backend components into a CI/CD pipeline to facilitate continuous performance monitoring, security testing, and scalability analysis.

- **Optimization Roadmap:** Create a roadmap that outlines future optimization efforts, including load testing, performance benchmarks, and security reviews.

- **Review and Alignment:** Schedule regular review sessions to ensure that the backend implementation aligns with overall project objectives and adapts to evolving requirements.
