# Implementation Tasks - Folder Structure and Framework Definitions

This document outlines the tasks required to define the game project's folder structure, select frameworks, libraries, and establish the overall technical stack. These tasks are derived from the specifications in [project.md] and our design documents.

## 1. Define Folder Structure

- **/src**: Contains all source code.
  - **/src/engine**: Core game engine and runtime logic.
  - **/src/ui**: Front-end code for the web application, built with Vue, Vite, and TypeScript. This folder will include the main Vue components, configuration files (like vite.config.ts), and entry points.
  - **/src/ai**: AI components and behavior modules.
  - **/src/physics**: Physics simulation modules.
  - **/src/networking**: Networking code (if multiplayer/online features are included).
  - **/src/backend**: Go backend services for server-side logic, API endpoints, and data management.

- **/assets**: Game assets such as models, textures, audio, etc.

- **/doc**: Documentation files including project specs, design docs, task lists, etc.

- **/build**: Build scripts and output directories.

- **/tests**: Unit and integration tests.

## 2. Framework and Library Selections

- **Front-End (UI):**
  - Use Vue.js as the web framework with TypeScript for type safety.
  - Leverage Tailwind CSS 4.x for responsive, modern styling.
  - Implement state management with Pinia or similar Vue-compatible solution.

- **Game Engine / Rendering:**
  - Use Three.js for 3D rendering in the browser.

- **Physics Simulation:**
  - Implement Cannon.js for physics simulation.

- **Backend:**
  - Develop server-side components in Go 1.24 using the standard net/http package.
  - Use WebSockets for real-time communication between frontend and backend.
  - Implement Couchbase for document-oriented data storage and Redis for caching.
  - Integrate Zitadel Cloud for authentication and user management.

- **Tooling and Build:**
  - Use Node.js with npm for frontend dependency management.
  - Set up Vite 6 with TypeScript 4 for frontend build tooling.
  - Use Docker for containerization and deployment.

## 3. Task List

1. **Finalize Folder Structure**
   [x] Create the initial directory outline as described above, incorporating Vue, Vite, and TypeScript for the front-end.

2. **Select Front-End Framework**
   [x] Finalize the front-end framework by choosing Vue as the basis for the web application, using the latest version of Vite for build tooling and Tailwind 4.x for styling.
   [x] Document the decision rationale.

3. **Evaluate Rendering Engine Options**
   [x] Compare Three.js and Babylon.js for 3D rendering capabilities in modern browsers.
   [x] Chose Three.js based on its maturity, flexibility, and community support.

4. **Choose a Physics Library**
   [x] Compare features and performance of Cannon.js vs Ammo.js.
   [x] Chose Cannon.js based on its simplicity and adequate performance for our needs.

5. **Outline AI Module Requirements**
   [x] Identify necessary AI behaviors, including simulation of NPC actions, dynamic environment interactions (traffic, events), real-time decision making, and resource optimization.
   [x] Document potential libraries or frameworks, while keeping the option open for custom AI solutions if required.

6. **Set Up Project Scaffold**
   [ ] Initialize the frontend project with Vue, Vite, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS:
     - [ ] Set up Vite 6 project with Vue 3 and TypeScript 4
     - [ ] Configure Tailwind CSS 4.x
     - [ ] Set up basic project structure and components
     - [ ] Create initial Three.js integration setup

   [ ] Initialize the Go backend project:
     - [ ] Set up a basic Go module structure with net/http package
     - [ ] Implement WebSocket server capability (using Gorilla WebSocket or similar)
     - [ ] Configure database connections for Couchbase and Redis
     - [ ] Set up Zitadel Cloud authentication integration

   [ ] Configure Docker for development:
     - [ ] Create Dockerfiles for frontend and backend
     - [ ] Set up docker-compose for local development

   [ ] Implement basic development workflow:
     - [ ] Configure hot reloading for frontend development
     - [ ] Set up Go development tools and live reloading
     - [ ] Create development documentation for the team

7. **Establish Data Communication**
   [ ] Define WebSocket communication protocol between frontend and backend
   [ ] Implement basic data models for game state synchronization
   [ ] Create API endpoints for core game functionality
   [ ] Set up data persistence with Couchbase and Redis

8. **Integrate Continuous Integration (CI)**
   [ ] Establish CI workflows to facilitate automated testing and builds
   [ ] Configure testing frameworks for both frontend and backend
   [ ] Set up code quality and linting tools
   [ ] Implement basic security scanning

9. **Create Development Environment Documentation**
   [ ] Document development setup instructions
   [ ] Create API documentation
   [ ] Document data models and schemas
   [ ] Prepare contribution guidelines for the team

## 4. Milestones

- **Initial Setup:** Complete the folder structure and project scaffold.
- **Framework Decisions:** Finalize choices for the front-end, rendering engine, physics library, and any AI tools.
- **Prototype Build:** Develop an initial working prototype demonstrating the chosen stack.
- **Documentation Update:** Continuously update this document as decisions are made and milestones are reached.

This task list provides the foundation for our implementation plan, focusing on establishing a robust structural and technological base to successfully build the game project.

## Multiplayer and Social Dynamics Implementation

- **User Progression System:** Allow users to start as individuals, create families, rent houses, and eventually construct their own homes.
- **Points and Leveling:** Enable users to earn points through gameplay, leveling up to unlock new features and opportunities.
- **City Mayor Election:** Implement a voting mechanism for eligible users to be elected as city mayors.
- **Mayor Functionalities:** Allow city mayors to construct key public infrastructures (schools, hospitals, cultural centers) and manage city projects and budgets.
- **Inter-City Interactions:** Develop systems for inter-city trade, business, and cooperative events.
- **Democratic Governance:** Integrate a system for democratic decision-making where city project budgets are proposed by the mayor and must be approved by the residents.
