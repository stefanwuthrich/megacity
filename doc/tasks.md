# Implementation Tasks - Folder Structure and Framework Definitions

This document outlines the tasks required to define the game project's folder structure, select frameworks, libraries, and establish the overall technical stack. These tasks are derived from the specifications in [project.md] and our design documents.

## 1. Define Folder Structure

- **/src**: Contains all source code.
  - **/src/engine**: Core game engine and runtime logic.
  - **/src/ui**: Front-end code for the web application, built with Vue, Vite, and TypeScript. This folder will include the main Vue components, configuration files (like vite.config.ts), and entry points.
  - **/src/ai**: AI components and behavior modules.
  - **/src/physics**: Physics simulation modules.
  - **/src/networking**: Networking code (if multiplayer/online features are included).

- **/assets**: Game assets such as models, textures, audio, etc.

- **/doc**: Documentation files including project specs, design docs, task lists, etc.

- **/build**: Build scripts and output directories.

- **/tests**: Unit and integration tests.

## 2. Framework and Library Selections

- **Front-End (UI):**
  - Use a modern web framework like **React** or **Vue**.
  - Leverage HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (or TypeScript) for a responsive, dynamic user interface.
  - Consider state management libraries (e.g., Redux for React or Vuex for Vue) and UI frameworks like Material-UI or Bootstrap.

- **Game Engine / Rendering:**
  - Evaluate WebGL-based engines such as **Three.js** or **Babylon.js** for rendering dynamic 3D environments in the browser.
  - Consider a fallback or complementary 2D rendering using canvas if required.

- **Physics Simulation:**
  - Investigate JavaScript physics libraries like **Cannon.js** or **Ammo.js** for realistic physics behavior.

- **AI Systems:**
  - Examine available libraries for implementing adaptive AI behaviors in JavaScript.
  - Consider custom solutions if advanced or specific AI logic is needed.

- **Tooling and Build:**
  - Use **Node.js** with npm (or yarn) for dependency management.
  - Set up build tools such as **Vite** with Typescript for a modern development workflow.
  - Implement CI/CD pipelines for testing and deployment.

## 3. Task List

1. **Finalize Folder Structure**
   [x] Create the initial directory outline as described above, incorporating Vue, Vite, and TypeScript for the front-end.

2. **Select Front-End Framework**
   [x] Finalize the front-end framework by choosing Vue as the basis for the web application, using the latest version of Vite for build tooling and Tailwind 4.x for styling.
   [x] Document the decision rationale.

3. **Evaluate Rendering Engine Options**
   [x] Compare Three.js and Babylon.js for 3D rendering capabilities in modern browsers.
   [x] Chose Three.js based on its maturity, flexibility, and community support.

4. **Choose a Physics Library**
   [x] Compare features and performance of Cannon.js vs Ammo.js.
   [x] Chose Cannon.js based on its simplicity and adequate performance for our needs.

5. **Outline AI Module Requirements**
   [x] Identify necessary AI behaviors, including simulation of NPC actions, dynamic environment interactions (traffic, events), real-time decision making, and resource optimization.
   [x] Document potential libraries or frameworks, while keeping the option open for custom AI solutions if required.

6. **Set Up Project Scaffold**
   [ ] Initialize the project with Node.js and npm.
   [ ] Configure build tools (Vite 6, Typescript 4, etc.) and create basic starter files.

7. **Integrate Continuous Integration (CI)**
   [ ] Establish CI workflows to facilitate automated testing and builds.

8. **Document All Decisions**
   [ ] Record technical choices and folder structure decisions in additional documentation as the project progresses.

## 4. Milestones

- **Initial Setup:** Complete the folder structure and project scaffold.
- **Framework Decisions:** Finalize choices for the front-end, rendering engine, physics library, and any AI tools.
- **Prototype Build:** Develop an initial working prototype demonstrating the chosen stack.
- **Documentation Update:** Continuously update this document as decisions are made and milestones are reached.

This task list provides the foundation for our implementation plan, focusing on establishing a robust structural and technological base to successfully build the game project.

## Multiplayer and Social Dynamics Implementation

- **User Progression System:** Allow users to start as individuals, create families, rent houses, and eventually construct their own homes.
- **Points and Leveling:** Enable users to earn points through gameplay, leveling up to unlock new features and opportunities.
- **City Mayor Election:** Implement a voting mechanism for eligible users to be elected as city mayors.
- **Mayor Functionalities:** Allow city mayors to construct key public infrastructures (schools, hospitals, cultural centers) and manage city projects and budgets.
- **Inter-City Interactions:** Develop systems for inter-city trade, business, and cooperative events.
- **Democratic Governance:** Integrate a system for democratic decision-making where city project budgets are proposed by the mayor and must be approved by the residents.
