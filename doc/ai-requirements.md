# AI Requirements and Design

This document outlines the detailed requirements and rationale behind the implementation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) within the game project. The AI module is critical for creating a dynamic, interactive city environment that responds realistically to in-game events.

## 1. Overview

The goal of the AI module is to simulate lifelike behaviors and interactions within the game world. The AI will be responsible for a range of tasks, including:

- **NPC Simulation**: Driving non-player characters (NPCs) such as pedestrians, drivers, and emergency services with realistic, adaptive behaviors.
- **Dynamic Environment Interaction**: Managing city elements like traffic, public services, and events to adapt dynamically to in-game conditions.
- **Real-Time Decision Making**: Processing live events and making immediate decisions to drive the simulation, facilitating smooth and synchronized interactions.
- **Resource Optimization**: Monitoring and managing game resource usage to maintain high performance and responsiveness across complex scenarios.

## 2. Detailed AI Behaviors

### 2.1 NPC Behavior Simulation

- **Objectives**: Create a system for NPCs that enables realistic daily routines, spontaneous interactions, and reactive behaviors when faced with unforeseen events.
- **Approach**: Incorporate randomness and probabilistic decision-making; consider behavior trees or state machines to structure NPC actions.

### 2.2 Dynamic Environment Interaction

- **Objectives**: Ensure the city environment feels alive by allowing elements like traffic flow, weather, and public events to change dynamically in response to AI decisions.
- **Approach**: Develop a system that tracks environmental variables and triggers AI responses, adjusting elements such as traffic signals, public service availability, and crowd dynamics.

### 2.3 Real-Time Decision Making

- **Objectives**: Enable the AI to process and react to real-time events (e.g., accidents, emergencies, large public gatherings) across the city.
- **Approach**: Utilize an event-driven architecture to capture triggers, possibly evaluating reinforcement learning or quicker rule-based algorithms to handle immediate decisions.

### 2.4 Resource Optimization

- **Objectives**: Maintain game performance by dynamically adjusting simulation details in response to system load and resource utilization.
- **Approach**: Implement monitoring of game performance metrics and apply optimization algorithms to balance detail and performance. Consider utility-based approaches for resource allocation.

## 3. Potential Libraries and Frameworks

- **Third-Party Libraries**: Review available JavaScript libraries for AI, though few are tailored to the unique demands of a dynamic city simulation. Libraries may offer components like behavior trees or state machines.
- **Custom Solutions**: Given the specialized nature of the game, a custom-built AI framework might be necessary to tightly integrate with the simulation and game engine.

## 4. Future Considerations

- **Algorithm Evaluation**: As the project evolves, further exploration into machine learning approaches (e.g., reinforcement learning) may be warranted to enhance decision-making capabilities.
- **Module Integration**: Continuous coordination with the game engine, physics module, and graphics system will be vital to ensure cohesive dynamic behavior across all systems.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Ongoing profiling and performance tuning should be conducted to ensure real-time responsiveness is maintained even as simulation complexity increases.

## 5. Conclusion

The AI module is designed to be the heart of our dynamic city simulation, providing the lifelike, adaptive behaviors that will define the player's experience. This document establishes a foundation for further detailed design, prototyping, and eventual refinement as development progresses.
