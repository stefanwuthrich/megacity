# Engine Physics Requirements and Design

This document outlines the requirements and design decisions for the physics engine component of our game project. It captures the rationale behind our selection and guides the integration of physics simulation into the overall game engine.

## 1. Overview

The physics engine is crucial for simulating realistic interactions within the dynamic city environment. It is responsible for collision detection, rigid body dynamics, and other physics-based interactions that help create a believable and interactive simulation.

## 2. Chosen Physics Library: Cannon.js

- **Rationale for Choosing Cannon.js:**
  - **Simplicity:** Cannon.js offers a straightforward API that is easy to integrate with our game architecture.
  - **Performance:** It provides adequate performance for the needs of a browser-based real-time simulation without incurring excessive overhead.
  - **Integration:** Cannon.js integrates well with Three.js for rendering, enabling a smooth coupling between visual and physical simulations.

## 3. Integration with the Game Engine

- The physics engine will be incorporated into the core game engine located in the `/src/engine` directory.
- It will work in tandem with the graphics module (using Three.js) to ensure that physical interactions are accurately represented on-screen.
- Key considerations include time-stepping for simulation accuracy, synchronization between physics and rendering updates, and handling collision events.

## 4. Functional Requirements

- **Collision Detection:** Calculate and respond to collisions between objects in the game world.
- **Rigid Body Dynamics:** Simulate the physical behavior of objects (movement, rotation, friction, and restitution).
- **Integration Hooks:** Provide clear interfaces for the game engine to update physics simulations each frame.
- **Event Handling:** Generate physics events (e.g., collisions or triggers) to inform other systems like AI or game logic.

## 5. Future Considerations

- As the project evolves, performance tuning and further optimization of the physics simulations may be required.
- Experimentation with more complex simulations or potential integration with other physics libraries (e.g., Ammo.js) can be considered if advanced features are needed.

## 6. Conclusion

The selection of Cannon.js supports our goals of simplicity and efficient performance for browser-based real-time simulations. Its integration with Three.js and the overall game engine will provide a solid foundation for realistic physical interactions in our dynamic city environment.
