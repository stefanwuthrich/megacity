# Database Requirements and Use Cases

This document outlines the various database requirements and use cases for the Megacity MMO Browser Game, as well as considerations for database selection and optimization strategies.

## Overview

As a complex MMO city simulation game, Megacity requires robust database solutions that can handle diverse data types, access patterns, and performance requirements. The game's various features demand different database characteristics, from high-performance real-time access to reliable long-term persistence.

- **Access Patterns**:
  - Regular reads and writes during active gameplay
  - Complex queries for city management
  - Batch updates for simulation cycles
- **Requirements**:
  - High data durability
  - Support for complex queries and data relationships
  - Transaction support for updates affecting multiple entities
  - Ability to handle large, evolving data structures

### 3. Real-time Game Data
- **Description**: Fast-access storage for active gameplay elements that require low-latency responses.
- **Data Types**: Active sessions, player positions, real-time events, current interactions.
- **Access Patterns**:
  - Very high read/write frequency
  - Time-sensitive operations
  - Short data lifetime
- **Requirements**:
  - Extremely low latency
  - High throughput
  - In-memory performance
  - Eventual consistency acceptable
  - Optimized for time-series or ephemeral data

### 4. Governance and Social Systems
- **Description**: Data supporting the game's political and social mechanics.
- **Data Types**: Mayor elections, budget proposals, voting records, inter-city agreements, social interactions.
- **Access Patterns**:
  - Burst activity during elections or voting periods
  - Complex aggregations for results
  - Infrequent writes, more frequent reads
- **Requirements**:
  - Strong consistency for voting integrity
  - Support for time-based data archiving
  - Efficient querying for complex social relationships

### 5. AI and Simulation Data
- **Description**: Data required for NPC behaviors, traffic simulation, and other AI-driven game elements.
- **Data Types**: NPC states, behavior patterns, simulation parameters, pathfinding data.
- **Access Patterns**:
  - High-volume reads for active simulations
  - Periodic batch updates
  - Pattern-based queries
- **Requirements**:
  - High read performance
  - Support for spatial data and queries
  - Efficient caching mechanisms
  - Ability to store and query complex behavior rules

### 6. Analytics and Metrics
- **Description**: Collection and analysis of game performance data and player behavior patterns.
- **Data Types**: Usage statistics, performance metrics, player behavior analytics, error logs.
- **Access Patterns**:
  - Write-heavy for data collection
  - Complex analytical queries
  - Time-series analysis
- **Requirements**:
  - Scalable storage for growing datasets
  - Efficient aggregation capabilities
  - Support for analytical workloads
  - Data retention policies

### 7. Content Management
- **Description**: Management of game assets, dynamic content, and localization data.
- **Data Types**: Asset metadata, content updates, localization strings, event configurations.
- **Access Patterns**:
  - Frequent reads, infrequent writes
  - Content lookups by various criteria
  - Versioning and update tracking
- **Requirements**:
  - Content delivery optimization
  - Support for structured and unstructured data
  - Versioning capabilities
  - Efficient text search and filtering

### 8. Transaction History
- **Description**: Historical records of game activities for audit, support, and analysis purposes.
- **Data Types**: Player actions, governance decisions, economic transactions, property transfers.
- **Access Patterns**:
  - Append-only writes
  - Occasional reads for auditing
  - Temporal queries and aggregations
- **Requirements**:
  - High write throughput
  - Efficient time-based querying
  - Immutable data storage
  - Long-term archiving capabilities

## Database Selection Considerations

Different use cases may benefit from specialized database technologies:

1. **Document Databases** (e.g., Couchbase, MongoDB):
   - Well-suited for user profiles, game state, and content management
   - Flexible schema for evolving game features
   - Good for complex, nested data structures

2. **In-Memory Databases** (e.g., Redis):
   - Ideal for real-time game data, active sessions, and caching
   - Provides extremely low latency
   - Supports pub/sub for real-time updates

3. **Time-Series Databases**:
   - Beneficial for analytics, metrics, and historical transactions
   - Optimized for time-based queries and aggregations

4. **Graph Databases**:
   - Could enhance social interactions and relationship management
   - Efficient for complex relationship queries
   - Potential for advanced NPC behavior modeling

5. **Relational Databases** (e.g., PostgreSQL):
   - Still valuable for structured data with complex relationships
   - Strong ACID compliance for critical transactions
   - Robust query capabilities for complex analytical needs

## Current Database Selections

Based on previous decisions documented in `backend-requirements.md`:

- **Couchbase**: Primary document-oriented database for flexible, scalable storage
- **Redis**: In-memory database for caching and real-time operations

These selections provide a good foundation but may require supplementation or refinement as specific use cases are developed in more detail.

## Recommendations for Implementation

1. **Layered Strategy**: Implement a multi-database approach that matches specific use cases to appropriate database technologies.

2. **Data Access Layer**: Create a unified data access layer that abstracts the underlying database technologies from game logic.

3. **Caching Strategy**: Develop a comprehensive caching strategy using Redis to reduce load on primary data stores.

4. **Sharding Plan**: For scale, consider data sharding strategies based on logical game divisions (e.g., cities, regions).

5. **Backup and Recovery**: Implement robust backup, recovery, and data migration processes.

6. **Monitoring**: Set up comprehensive monitoring of database performance and availability.

These database use cases and considerations will guide the implementation of the data persistence layer for the Megacity MMO Browser Game.
